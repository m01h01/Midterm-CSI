                        The global average temperature has risen 1.1°C since 1910. In Australia, the average rise is a little over 1.4°C. In 2019, Australia had both the driest and the hottest year on record. 
                       The impacts of extreme heat on plants, coral reefs, animals and people (particularly at-risk people; the young, elderly, and suffers of chronic disease) is becoming ever more visible. 
                        In Central Australia and the Northern Territory many trees, including river species and mangroves are dying, along with smaller plants, birds and animals. Coral reefs are dying in warmer waters.
                        It is not well known that many more people have died in the heatwaves before and after major bushfires in recent years than in the fires themselves.

                        Fire has always been a part of the Australian landscape. The global average temperature has risen 1.1°C since 1910. In Australia higher temperatures create drier conditions, and this increases the ‘likelihood and intensity of wildfires, and megafires.’
                        From late 2019 to early 2020, fires burnt across most of Australia with such an intensity, extent and duration not previously experienced. The fires were devastating to people, animals, birds, to insects, to habitats, homes, sacred sites and infrastructure. Permanently ‘wet’ forests that usually suppress fires burnt for the first time.

                        <p>Climate change has caused a rise in global sea levels, contributing to increased flooding, shoreline erosion and hazards from storms. A large portion of the worldwide population lives in coastal areas, making them particularly vulnerable.
                            Under current global climate change projections, sea levels will rise anywhere between 45 and 82 cm by 2090. If land-based ice sheets—like the one covering Antarctica—melt, then this level will be even higher.
                            It may not sound like much, but with most of Australia’s population living along the coast this will have a huge impact on coastal infrastructure, community livelihoods, agriculture and habitability. It puts mangrove forests and low-lying freshwater wetlands at risk. 
                           And it means people, infrastructure and water resources further inland will also be affected—encroaching sea-levels bring extreme high sea-level events like storm surges, flooding and erosion.

                            The impacts of climate change include more frequent extreme weather like bushfires, heatwaves, storms and cyclones. Not only are property, crops and infrastructure lost, so too are lives. Often, it’s the poor and vulnerable members of society who are likely to be hit the hardest from these events. 
                            Those who can’t afford to cool their house, don’t have a place to live, who aren’t able to move, or who can’t access refuges such as shopping centres, libraries and emergency shelters.
                            Most of the Australian population (about 90%) lives along the coast. And it is here where extreme events are likely to overlap, or ‘compound’. For example, a tropical cyclone comes with intense rainfall, storm surges and flooding. But Australia has regional, rural and outback communities too.

There is the loss of the things people care about; loss of sacred spaces and other places of significance for all, including the Great Barrier Reef. There is also the erosion and submerging of coastal lands and islands (and the connection to ancestors, senses of self and belonging that reside in that land), loss of livelihoods due to severe weather, droughts and disasters, and many worries about the future. These, with other impacts, are increasingly leading to ‘climate anxiety’, grief and depression across Australia. 
                            Mental health organisations are supporting children, young adults and adults to manage these conditions.
